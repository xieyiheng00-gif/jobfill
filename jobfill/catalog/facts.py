"""Fact schema: every single-valued thing jobfill can store about the candidate.

Tiers
-----
1  static     Rarely changes: identity, contact, work authorization, EEO,
              legal/background, standing consents. Collected once at setup.
2  evolving   Changes over months: compensation, availability, preferences,
              documents, and the narrative base material the AI tailors.
              ``review_days`` makes ``jobfill status`` flag stale values.
3  generated  Never stored as a fact. Per-application answers written by the
              agent (see ``questions.py``); they live in the answer log.

Repeating data (education, experience, projects, skills, languages, stories...)
lives in records, see ``records.py``.

``setup`` controls what ``jobfill missing`` asks for:
required     setup is not complete without it
recommended  asked during setup, can be skipped
optional     asked only when a form needs it

``sensitive`` facts are never inferred from documents or names. The agent must
ask the candidate directly, and "decline" is always a valid answer.
